## Design process
I choose a combination of React, Redux and Typescript to do this project.
Redux makes the code longer, but I like the idea of having a central store for data.
Typescript makes the code clearer and easier to navigate than plain Javascript.
Also I choose bootstrap because it helps to build fast and reduce time handling CSS.

For a quick project like this, I want to keep things simple.
So the layout is very basic contains 3 parts: navigation bar, header and content body.
